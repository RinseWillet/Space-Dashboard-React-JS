Space Dashboard is a little react app I wrote to teach myself the basics of working with React JS. It exploits various NASA API's (photo of the day, ISS location, NASA Insight) and uses the data to show a daily NASA photo, track the location of ISS relative to the user's location, and present a daily updated weather report for the surface of Mars in the Elysium Planitia plain. 

The app uses react-vis to generate a graph of the Martian weather data, while also making use of Leaflet and google-map-react to show the location of the NASA Insight probe on Mars and the location of International Space Station respectively. The styling is very much inspired by my old 8088 XT IBM pc with Hercules Monochrome graphics card.

to do list:

- update the ISS Map to center on and track the current location of ISS
- create a radio button to change the base-maps in the Martian weather app
- streamline the code further (DRY)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
